Message from the Society of Shadows
Ethan,

You’ve been deceived. Annabelle is not trying to break a curse, nor is she seeking redemption or a chance to move on. Her intentions are far more sinister.

Annabelle is orchestrating a ritual—her final and most dangerous act. By deceiving you and others into aiding her, she intends to return to the living world not as a tormented spirit seeking peace, but as a force of destruction. This ritual will unleash something far more horrific than you can imagine upon the living.
